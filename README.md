jLens
=====

Auto-generated [lenses](http://stackoverflow.com/q/8307370/1333025) for Java beans.

Requirements: Java 1.6 or later.

What are lenses?
----------------

`Lens<R,F>` is an object that knows how to retrieve or update something of type
`F` inside objects of type `R`.
(See also [this SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/8307370/1333025).)

Each `Lens` has two operations:

    public void set(R record, F fieldValue);
    public F get(R target);

This is similar to standard Java's getters and setters, but:

- Getters/setters are methods of an object. Lenses are separate objects that
  get the object to work on as an argument.
- Because they're separate objects, we can operate on them. For example, we can
  pass them as arguments to methods.
- Similarly to functions, lenses can be composed. If we have `Lens<R,F>` and
  `Lens<F,U>` we can compose them to get `Lens<R,U>`.

What does jLens do?
-------------------

Apart from defining the core classes and interfaces (such as `Lens`), jLens
contains an annotation processor that automatically generates lenses from bean
setters/getters during compilation. All we need is to annotate our bean class
with `@LensProperties`. For example if we have class

    @LensProperties
    public class Person {
        private String name;
        private Candidate seller;

        public String getName()       { return this.name; }
        public void setName(String v) { this.name = v; }

        public Candidate getSeller()        { return this.seller; }
        public void setSeller(Candidate v)  { this.seller = v; }
    }

the processor will generate a helper class with static fields:

    public class Person_L {
        public static final AbstractLens<Person,String> name = ...;
        public static final AbstractLens<Person,Candidate> seller = ...;
    }

Composition

TODO

See the examples package for a complete example that generates the lenses and
tests the generated lenses.
